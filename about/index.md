Welcome.

I'm David Peterson, Senior Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.isitedesign.com" target="_blank">ISITE Design</a>. You've somehow stumbled upon my blog on all things Sitecore. You may see some other non-Sitecore related topics from time to time.

I used to call the <a href="http://www.isitedesign.com/contact" target="_blank">Boston office</a> my home, but have since moved to <a href="http://www.west-chester.com/" target="_blank">West Chester, PA</a>, where I now work remotely. I'm a Sitecore Technical MVP and run the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Sitecore-User-Group-Philadelphia/" target="_blank">Philadelphia Sitecore Users Group</a>. 

If you're on social media (who isn't these days?) you'll find me most active here:

* Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/PetersonDave" target="_blank">Twitter</a>
* Follow me on <a href="https://github.com/PetersonDave" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
* Follow me on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/petersond/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>

Not into any of the above? Drop me a line: <a href="mailto:david.scott.peterson@gmail.com">david.scott.peterson@gmail.com</a>.

## Background

I've held numerous positions building both web and Windows-based applications for organizations such as Grand Circle Travel, The Boston Public Schools, Investors Bank and Trust and Towers Perrin. I enjoy collaborating with talented teams of developers, sharing ideas and helping others learn.

As a remote worker, I'm constantly looking for ways to improve and become more connected to both clients and my team (East and West coast). Have suggestions? Pass them along.

## Back in the Day

Growing up, I was big into video games like every other kid in the late 80's and early 90's. At the start of High School I got a dedicated phone line, 2400 baud modem and started <a href="http://bbslist.textfiles.com/617/617.txt" target="_blank">The Power Surge BBS</a>. While running on PCBoard, we had integrated FidoNet and built numerous "online" games. 

After having attended a couple programming classes at Northeastern University in my senior year of high school, I knew software development was where I wanted to be. I went on to study Computer Science at <a href="http://www.drexel.edu/" target="_blank">Drexel University</a> and the rest is history...

## Manifesto

What I'm about:

* Knowledge sharing FTW!
* White boarding is a must
* Paired programming (in moderation of course)
* Waterfall stinks
* Agile all the way
* <a href="https://github.com/PetersonDave?tab=repositories" target="_blank">Open source</a>
* Community code reviews
* Shooting Nerf guns when I'm in Portland
